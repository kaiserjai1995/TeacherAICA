				Now, let us analyze the letters A - D
			</p> 

			<p>
				&#9658;Did you find <b>A</b> CORRECT? Yes it is CORRECT. It is because the base is multiplied repeatedly two times by itself since the expression's exponent is 2.
			</p>

			<p>
				&#9658;Did you find <b>B</b> INCORRECT? Yes it is INCORRECT. The solution is correct but the final answer is not, It should be 16, NOT 8.
			</p>

			<p>
				&#9658;Did you find <b>C</b> INCORRECT? Yes it is INCORRECT. The final answer is correct but the solution is not, It should be 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2, NOT 2 * 5.
			</p>

			<p>
				&#9658;Did you find <b>D</b> CORRECT? Yes it is CORRECT. The final answer is correct as well as the solution, like in the letter A, it is multiplied by itself three times since the exponent is 3.
			</p>

				Now, give the value of each of the following:
