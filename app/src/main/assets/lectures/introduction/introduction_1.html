				Hi, my name is AICA and I will be your teacher and instructor for all the lecture sessions. But first let me tell you something about myself. I am an entity designed to help you learn how to solve problems related to the laws of exponents. I will help you understand its concepts and theories so you can use them to solve even more complicated problems in the future.
