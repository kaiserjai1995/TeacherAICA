				So let me tell you the format of my discussions. In every lecture sessions, there will be formal discussion of the topic, I will be stating an exponent law, and I will be elaborating it in simple terms so that you can follow along the discussion. I will also be providing examples with explanations on how to solve, to help you understand how the answer came to be. At certain lecture sessions, there will be a quiz to test if you have learned the topic. Donâ€™t worry too much though, I will guide you through the quiz.
