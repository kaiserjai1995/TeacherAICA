				During the quiz, I am designed to detect errors from your part, so expect an immediate feedback from me when you enter the wrong answer. There is no time limit, so do take your time in solving it. If you feel unconfident in answering the quiz, you can always opt to abort solving it by pressing the Back button and answer it later.
