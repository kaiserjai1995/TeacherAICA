				<br>Are the exponents that you have found the same?
				<br>
				In letter A, YES, they are the same.
				<br>
				In letter B, NO, they are not the same and the exponents are different.
				<br>
				In letter C, YES, they are the same.
				<br>
				In letter D, NO, they are not the same and the exponents are different.
