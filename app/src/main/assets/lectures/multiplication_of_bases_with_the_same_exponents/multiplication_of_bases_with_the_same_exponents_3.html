				&#9658;The problem in letter A,  b<sup>3</sup> &sdot; c<sup>3</sup>, it is shown that the bases are the same, so we copy the base and add the exponents.  b<sup>3</sup>.
				<br>

				<br>
				&#9658;Regarding the problem in letter B, we change the exponent to be similar with each other, 2<sup>2</sup> &sdot; 3<sup>2</sup>, It is shown that the bases are different, so we multiply the base first which results to 6 and then copy the exponent afterwards. The result will be 6<sup>2</sup>.  Afterwards, simplify the answer. The result is 36.

				&#9658;The problem in letter C,  5<sup>2</sup> &sdot; 8<sup>2</sup>, it is shown that the bases are different, so we multiply the base first and then add the exponents afterwards. The result will be 40<sup>2</sup>. Simplifying it will result to 1600.

				&#9658;The problem in letter D, 5<sup>2</sup> &sdot; 5<sup>3</sup>, it is shown that the exponents are different, so we change the exponent to be similar with each other. 5<sup>2</sup> &sdot; 5<sup>2</sup>.
				We multiply the base again then it will result to a value of 25 then we copy the exponents to give us 25<sup>2</sup>. Simplifying the problem further will result to a value of 625.
