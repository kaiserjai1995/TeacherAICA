				Here, we simplify an expression by using the product rule for adding exponents.
			</p>

			<p>
				To develop a pattern for adding exponential expressions with the same base, we consider the product <i>x<sup>2</sup> &sdot; x<sup>3</sup></i>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The expression <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> means that <i>x</i> is to be used as a factor two times and the expression <i>x<sup>3</sup></i> means that the x is to be used as a factor three times. So, we will have:
			</p>

			<p>
				<table align="center">
					<tr>
						<td>x<sup>2</sup>x<sup>3</sup> = x &sdot; x <i>(2 factors of x)</i> &nbsp; &sdot; &nbsp; x &sdot; x &sdot; x<i> (3 factors of x)</i> </td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td> = x &sdot; x &sdot; x &sdot; x &sdot; x (5 factors of x)</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td> = x<sup>5</sup></td>
					</tr>

				</table>
