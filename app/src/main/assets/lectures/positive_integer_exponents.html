	<h1>Positive Integer Exponents</h1>
</div>

	Let start the lesson of law of exponent.
	<p>
	But before we proceed to the different laws of exponents, you should have mastered the multiplication.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>I have here an activity in order for you to practice the multiplcation.
	</p>
	<p>
	===>(kaya ba to generated??)
	</p>
	<p>
	1.) 3 x 3 = ___________ 				(Ans. 9)
	</p>
	<p>
	2.) 4 x 4 x 4 = ___________ 			(Ans. 64)
	</p>
	<p>
	3.) 5 x 5 x 5 = ___________ 			(Ans. 125)
	</p>
	<p>
	4.) 2 x 2 x 2 = ___________ 			(Ans. 8)
	</p>
	<p>
	5.) 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = ___________ 		(Ans. 16)
	</p>
	<p>
	6.) 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = ___________ 	(Ans. 32)

	</p>

	<p>
	Excellent!!! you got correct answer!
	</p>
	now, in this expression 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32 is also can be like this 2<sup>5</sup> and 4 x 4 x 4 = 64 is also can be like this 4<sup>3</sup> and so on.
	<p>
	In the exponential expression <i>x<sup>n</sup></i>, <i>x</i> is called the <b>base</b> and <i>n</i> is called the <b>exponent</b>. The entire expression is called the <b>power</b> of x.
	<br>
	<div align="center"><i>Base &rarr;x<sup>n &larr; Exponent</sup></i></div>
	</p>
	<p>
	Now, I have an exercises for you. Try to find the CORRECT and INCORRECT answer or solution of the following.
	</p>
	<p>
	A.) 4<sup>2</sup> = 4 x 4 = 16
	</p>
	<p>
	B.) 2<sup>4</sup> = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 8
	</p>
	<p>
	C.) 2<sup>5</sup> = 2 x 5 = 10
	</p>
	<p>
	D.) 3<sup>3</sup> = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27
	</p>

	<p>
	Did you find the CORRECT and INCORRENT expression above?
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter A did you found out this is CORRECT? Yes it is. Because the base is multiplied repeatedly two times by itself because the exponent is 2.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter B did you found out this is INCORRECT? Yes it is. The solution is correct but the final answer is not, It should be 16, NOT 8.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter C did you found out this is INCORRECT? Yes it is. The final answer is correct but the solution is not, It should be 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, NOT 2 x 5.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter D did you found out this is CORRECT? Yes it is. The final answer is correct and also the solution, like in the letter A, it's multiplied by itself three times because the exponent is 3.
	</p>

	<p>
	Now, in this following, give the value of each of the following as fast as you can.
	</p>

	<p>
	A.) 2<sup>3</sup> = ?
	</p>
	<p>
	B.) 2<sup>5</sup> = ?
	</p>
	<p>
	C.) 3<sup>4</sup> = ?
	</p>
	<p>
	D.) 10<sup>6</sup> = ?
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter A did you found out the answer is 8? Yes it is. Because the base is multiplied repeatedly three times by itself because the exponent is 3. it goes like this 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter B did you found out the answer is 32? Yes it is. Because the base is multiplied repeatedly five times by itself because the exponent is 5. it goes like this 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter C did you found out the answer is 81? Yes it is. Because the base is multiplied repeatedly four times by itself because the exponent is 4. it goes like this 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81.
	</p>
	<p>
	&#9658;In letter C did you found out the answer is 1,000,000? Yes it is. Because the base is multiplied repeatedly six times by itself because the exponent is 6. it goes like this 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 1,000,000.
	</p>

	Great!! Now you know the basic law of exponent you can now move to the next lesson to learn more. GOOD LUCK!
